ðŸŸ¡ Problem Statement: Build a Star Rating Component
ðŸ“Œ Objective:
Create an interactive Star Rating UI Component using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which allows users to rate an item (such as a product, service, or article) from 1 to 5 stars.

ðŸŽ¯ Requirements:
UI Design:

Display 5 stars in a row.

Use icons (e.g., Unicode â˜… or SVG) to represent stars.

Unselected stars should appear in a neutral color (e.g., gray).

Hovering over a star should highlight all stars up to that point.

Selected stars should remain highlighted (e.g., yellow/gold) even after the cursor leaves.

Interaction Logic:

When a user clicks on a star, save the selected rating.

If a user clicks on the same star again, it should not reset unless specified.

Display the selected rating (e.g., "You rated: 4/5").
