ðŸ”µ Problem Statement: Build an Enhanced Counter Component
ðŸ“Œ Objective:
Create an interactive and user-friendly Counter Component that allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a value. Enhance it with useful features like keyboard support, limits, and dynamic styling using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

ðŸŽ¯ Requirements:
Basic Functionality:

A displayed number representing the current count (starting at 0).

Three buttons:

Increment (+)

Decrement (âˆ’)

Reset (â†º)

Functional Logic:

Clicking Increment increases the count by 1.

Clicking Decrement decreases the count by 1 (but should not go below 0 unless specified).

Clicking Reset sets the count back to 0.

Enhanced Features:

Allow the user to set minimum and maximum limits for the counter (e.g., 0 to 10).

Disable the increment/decrement buttons when limits are reached.

Keyboard support (e.g., â†‘ for increment, â†“ for decrement, R for reset).

Color feedback based on the count:

Neutral color at 0.

Green when incremented.

Red when decremented.

Gray when disabled.
